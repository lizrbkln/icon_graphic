  <h1>Pregnant And Targeted For Misinformation In NYC</h1>
  <p id="mybyline">by Liz Rosenberg / October 3, 2022</p>

    <!-- YOUR CONTENT GOES HERE -->

<div class="intro">
    <p>Imagine someone you love is pregnant or thinks they might be. <br><br> This pregnancy is unplanned or unwanted or both.<br><br> Maybe...<br> They aren't ready to tell anyone else. <br> They already have a child.<br> They are strapped for cash.<br> <br>Overall, they want to know ALL of their options.</p>
    </div>
<br>

<br>
    <p>New York State<a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/S470">says</a>people are entitled to “to obtain accurate, non-coercive health care information and timely access to a comprehensive range of reproductive and sexual health care services in alignment with their health care needs and that supports personal decision-making.” Good news for your loved one, right?</p>
<br>
<div class="google_search">
  <img src="google_search.png" alt="Google search showing fake clinics and tiny google type saying they don't perform abortions." class= "responsive"><figcaption>Notice the Google dislcaimer: "Does not provide abortions."</figcaption>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>Finding a medical clinic that meets this legal standard might prove difficult because in New York City for every five legitimate clinics offering what would meet the state’s standard, there are six Crisis Pregnancy Centers (CPCs), often referred to as "fake clinics."
      <br>
        <br>
      Now imagine your loved one lives in West Virginia where abortion is banned with very limited exceptions. They come to New York City looking for a clinic that performs abortions but a web search directs them to a CPC instead. They miss the fine print saying "Does not provide abortions" (placed there by Google).</p>
<br>
<strong>What might they experience at a CPC?</strong>

          <div class="icondescription">A sonogram “technician," who might just be a volunteer, will refer to them as “mom” and point to the screen describing their “baby” in celebratory terms. The goal of these practices is to create a bond with the fetus.

          <div class="icondescription">A lot of<a href="https://nownyc.org/womens-justice-now/issues/get-the-facts-crisis-pregnancy-centers/">misinformation about abortion</a>that could include: “It’s dangerous. It causes breast cancer. It’s psychologically damaging. It can lead to sterility.” Exposure to images of full-term babies who they will be told were aborted. The images can have a chilling effect and are completely misleading. The reality is far closer to what the<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/ss/ss6713a1.htm">Centers for Disease Control found</a>in 2015. 65% of abortions were performed before 8 weeks and nearly all (91%) were performed before 14 weeks.

    <p>According to Aviva Zadoff, Director of Advocacy and Volunteer Engagement at the National Council for Jewish Women, “low income and college neighborhoods are big targets of CPCs because those are two groups where if you advertise free services, that's going to be very enticing.” </p>

<br>

    <p>Zadoff, who is responsible for updating the Pro-Truth map of actual abortion providers and CPCs, says so far the number of CPCs hasn't gone up, but she is concerned  newcomers to New York City might be particularly at-risk. According to Zadoff, there is a CPC in the Bronx with a “Parenthood Planned” banner. Right across the street? A real Planned Parenthood. Anyone, especially a non-native English speaker, could find themselves in the wrong place.</p>
